Every quarter after the NYSE market closes, companies that are publicly traded on the NYSE are obliged to release their quarterly earnings, which within seconds causes their stock price to non-linearly jump or fall in after-hours tradings. The purpose of this project is to try to automate the analysis of these quarterly reports to extract the trading sentiment to have an edge in after-market trading of a tech company. 

Large language models (LLMs) have evolved to overcome the challenges of extracting sentiment from textual data, especially in financial industry, where obstacles stem from the need for domain-specific knowledge and the predictive purpose of using this information for future trading decisions.

Using a dataset containing 974 sentences from Q&A sections of five Meta’s earnings calls, from 2024 to Q1/2025, the project investigates the potential of two LLMs - GPT-5 and DeepSeek-V3 in sentiment classification and aspect-based sentiment analysis against human-labelled benchmarks. The results encourage the application of LLMs as a tool in automating the financial sentiment analysis process to understand fast-moving technology trends that are mentioned in conference calls. This includes summarizing and extracting the key terms in each earnings call using Large Language Models.
