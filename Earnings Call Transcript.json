      "Thanks Ken, and hey everyone -- thanks for joining.",
      "It's been a good start to the year -- both in terms of product momentum and business performance.",
      "We estimate that more than 3.2 billion people use at least one of our apps each day, and we're seeing healthy growth in the US.",
      "I want to call out WhatsApp specifically, where the number of daily actives and message sends in the US keeps gaining momentum and I think we're on a good path there.",
      "We've also made good progress on our AI and metaverse efforts, and that's where I’m going to focus most of my comments today.",
      "We're building a number of different AI services, from Meta AI, our AI assistant that you can ask any question across our apps and glasses, to creator AIs that help creators engage their communities and that fans can interact with, to business AIs that we think every business eventually on our platform will use to help customers buy things and get customer support, to internal coding and development AIs, to hardware like glasses for people to interact with AIs, and a lot more.",
      "Last week we had the major release of our new version of Meta AI that is now powered by our latest model, Llama 3.",
      "And our goal with Meta AI is to build the world's leading AI service both in quality and usage.",
      "The initial rollout of Meta AI is going well.",
      "Tens of millions of people have already tried it.",
      "The feedback is very positive and, when I first checked in with our teams, the majority of feedback we were getting was people asking us to release Meta AI for them, wherever they are.",
      "We've started launching Meta AI in some English‐speaking countries, and we'll roll out in more languages and countries over the coming months.",
      "You all know our product development playbook by this point.",
      "We release an early version of a product to a limited audience to gather feedback and start improving it, and then once we think it's ready then we make it available to more people.",
      "That early release was last fall and with this release we're now moving to that next growth phase of our playbook.",
      "We believe that Meta AI with Llama 3 is now the most intelligent AI assistant that you can freely use.",
      "And now that we have the superior quality product, we're making it easier for lots of people to use it within WhatsApp, Messenger, Instagram, and Facebook.",
      "Now in addition to answering more complex queries, a few other notable and unique features from this release: Meta AI now creates animations from still images, and now generates high quality images so fast that it can create and update them as you're typing, which is pretty awesome.",
      "I've seen a lot of people commenting about this experience online and how they've never seen or experienced anything like it before.",
      "In terms of the core AI model and intelligence that’s powering Meta AI, I'm very pleased with how Llama 3 has come together so far.",
      "The 8B and 70B parameter models that we released are best-in-class for their scale.",
      "The 400+B parameter model that we're still training seems on track to be industry-leading on several benchmarks.",
      "And I expect that our models are just going to improve further from open source contributions.",
      "Overall, I view the results our teams have achieved here as another key milestone in showing that we have the talent, data, and ability to scale infrastructure to build the world’s leading AI models and services.",
      "And this leads me to believe that we should invest significantly more over the coming years to build even more advanced models and the largest scale AI services in the world.",
      "As we're scaling capex and energy expenses for AI, we'll continue focusing on operating the rest of our company efficiently.",
      "But realistically, even with shifting many of our existing resources to focus on AI, we'll still grow our investment envelope meaningfully before we make much revenue from some of these new products.",
      "I think it's worth calling out that we've historically seen a lot of volatility in our stock during this phase of our product playbook ‐‐ where we're investing in scaling a new product but aren't yet monetizing it.",
      "We saw this with Reels, Stories, as News Feed transitioned to mobile and more.",
      "And I also expect to see a multi‐year investment cycle before we've fully scaled Meta AI, business AIs, and more into the profitable services I expect as well.",
      "Historically, investing to build these new scaled experiences in our apps has been a very good long term investment for us and for investors who have stuck with us.",
      "And the initial signs are quite positive here too.",
      "But building the leading AI will also be a larger undertaking than the other experiences we've added to our apps, and this is likely going to take several years.",
      "On the upside, once our new AI services reach scale, we have a strong track record of monetizing them effectively.",
      "There are several ways to build a massive business here, including scaling business messaging, introducing ads or paid content into AI interactions, and enabling people to pay to use bigger AI models and access more compute.",
      "And on top of those, AI is already helping us improve app engagement which naturally leads to seeing more ads, and improving ads directly to deliver more value.",
      "So if the technology and products evolve in the way that we hope, each of those will unlock massive amounts of value for people and business for us over time.",
      "We are seeing good progress on some of these efforts already.",
      "Right now, about 30% of the posts on Facebook feed are delivered by our AI recommendation system.",
      "That's up 2x over the last couple of years.",
      "And for the first time ever, more than 50% of the content people see on Instagram is now AI recommended.",
      "AI has also always been a huge part of how we create value for advertisers by showing people more relevant ads, and if you look at our two end-to-end AI-powered tools, Advantage+ Shopping and Advantage+ App Campaigns, revenue flowing through those has more than doubled since last year.",
      "We're also going to continue to be very focused on efficiency as we scale Meta AI and other AI services.",
      "Some of this will come from improving how we train and run models.",
      "Some improvements will come from the open source community -- where improving cost efficiency is one of the main areas I expect that open sourcing will help us improve, similar to what we saw with Open Compute.",
      "We'll also keep making progress on building more of our own silicon.",
      "Our Meta Training and Inference Accelerator chip has successfully enabled us to run some of our recommendations-related workloads on this less expensive stack, and as this program matures over the coming years we plan to expand this to more of our workloads as well.",
      "And of course as we ramp these investments, we will also continue to carefully manage headcount and other expense growth throughout the company.",
      "In addition to our work on AI, our other long term focus is the metaverse.",
      "It's been interesting to see how these two themes have come together.",
      "This is clearest when you look at glasses.",
      "I used to think that AR glasses wouldn't really be a mainstream product until we had full holographic displays -- and I still think that will be awesome and is mature state of the product.",
      "But now it seems pretty clear that there's also a meaningful market for fashionable AI glasses without a display.",
      "Glasses are the ideal device for an AI assistant because you can let them see what you see and hear what you hear, so they have full context on what's going on around you as they help you with whatever you're trying to do.",
      "Our launch this week of Meta AI with Vision on the glasses is a good example where you can now ask questions about things you're looking at.",
      "One strategy dynamic that I've been reflecting on is that an increasing amount of our Reality Labs work is going towards serving our AI efforts.",
      "We currently report on our financials as if Family of Apps and Reality Labs were two completely separate businesses, but strategically I think of them as fundamentally the same business with the vision of Reality Labs to build the next generation of computing platforms in large part so that way we can build the best apps and experiences on top of them.",
      "Over time, we'll need to find better ways to articulate the value that’s generated here across both segments so it doesn't just seem like our hardware costs increase as our glasses ecosystem scales",
      "but all the value flows to a different segment.",
      "The Ray-Ban Meta glasses that we built with Essilor Luxottica continue to do well and are sold out in many styles and colors, so we're working to make more and release additional styles as quickly as we can.",
      "We just released the new cat-eye Skyler design yesterday, which is more feminine, and in general, I'm optimistic about our approach of starting with classics and expanding with an increasing diversity of options over time.",
      "If we want everyone to be able to use wearable AI, I think eyewear is a bit different from phones or watches in that people are going to want very different designs.",
      "So I think our approach of partnering with leading eyewear brands will help us serve more of the market.",
      "I think a similar open ecosystem approach will help us expand the mixed reality headset market over time as well.",
      "We announced that we're opening up Meta Horizon OS, the operating system we've built to power Quest.",
      "As the ecosystem grows, I think there will be sufficient diversity in how people use mixed reality that there will be demand for more designs than we'll be able to build.",
      "For example, a work-focused headset may be slightly less designed for motion but may want to be lighter by connecting to your laptop.",
      "A fitness-focused headset may be lighter with sweat-wicking materials.",
      "An entertainment-focused headset may prioritize the highest-resolution displays over everything else.",
      "A gaming-focused headset may prioritize peripherals and haptics, or a device that comes with Xbox controllers and a Game Pass subscription out of the box.",
      "To be clear, I think that our first-party Quest devices will continue to be the most popular headsets as we see today, and we'll continue focusing on advancing the state-of-the-art tech and making it accessible to everyone.",
      "But I also think that opening our ecosystem and opening our operating system will help grow the ecosystem even faster.",
      "In addition to AI and the metaverse, we're seeing good improvements across our apps.",
      "I touched on some of the most important trends with WhatsApp growth in the US and AI-powered recommendations in our feeds and Reels already, but I wanted to mention that video continues to be a bright spot.",
      "This month we launched an update full-screen video player on Facebook that brings together Reels, longer videos, and live content into a single experience with a unified recommendation system.",
      "On Instagram, Reels and video continue to drive engagement, with Reels alone now making up 50% of the time that’s spent within the app.",
      "There are now more than 150M monthly actives, and it continues to generally be on the trajectory I hoped to see.",
      "My daughters would want me to mention that Taylor Swift is now on Threads -- that was a big deal in my house.",
      "Okay, that's what I wanted to cover today.",
      "I'm proud of the progress we've made so far this year.",
      "We've got a lot more execution ahead to fulfill the opportunities ahead of us.",
      "A big thank you to our teams driving all these advances, and to all of you for being on this journey with us."

      "All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted.",
      "Q1 total revenue was $36.5 billion, up 27% on both a reported and constant currency basis.",
      "Q1 total expenses were $22.6 billion, up 6% compared to last year.",
      "In terms of the specific line items: Cost of revenue increased 9%, as higher infrastructure-related costs were partially offset by lapping Reality Labs inventory-related valuation adjustments.",
      "R&D increased 6%, driven mostly by higher headcount-related expenses and infrastructure costs, which were partially offset by lower restructuring costs.",
      "Marketing & Sales decreased 16%, due mainly to lower restructuring costs, professional services and marketing spend.",
      "G&A increased 20%, as higher legal-related expenses were partially offset by lower restructuring costs.",
      "We ended the first quarter with over 69,300 employees, up 3% from Q4.",
      "First quarter operating income was $13.8 billion, representing a 38% operating margin.",
      "Our tax rate for the quarter was 13%.",
      "Net income was $12.4 billion or $4.71 per share.",
      "Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $6.7 billion, driven by investments in servers, data centers and network infrastructure.",
      "We repurchased $14.6 billion of our Class A common stock and paid $1.3 billion in dividends to shareholders, ending the quarter with $58.1 billion in cash and marketable securities and $18.4 billion in debt.",
      "I’ll begin with our Family of Apps segment.",
      "Our community across the Family of Apps continues to grow, with approximately 3.2 billion people using at least one of our Family of Apps on a daily basis in March.",
      "Q1 Total Family of Apps revenue was $36.0 billion, up 27% year over year.",
      "Q1 Family of Apps ad revenue was $35.6 billion, up 27% or 26% on a constant currency basis.",
      "Within ad revenue, the online commerce vertical was the largest contributor to year-over-year growth, followed by gaming and entertainment and media.",
      "On a user geography basis, ad revenue growth was strongest in Rest of World and Europe at 40% and 33%, respectively.",
      "Asia-Pacific grew 25% and North America grew 22%.",
      "In Q1, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 20% and the average price per ad increased 6%.",
      "Impression growth was mainly driven by Asia-Pacific and Rest of World.",
      "Pricing growth was driven by advertiser demand, which was partially offset by strong impression growth, particularly from lower-monetizing regions and surfaces.",
      "Family of Apps other revenue was $380 million in Q1, up 85%, driven by business messaging revenue growth from our WhatsApp Business Platform.",
      "We continue to direct the majority of our investments toward the development and operation of our Family of Apps.",
      "In Q1, Family of Apps expenses were $18.4 billion, representing approximately 81% of our overall expenses.",
      "Family of Apps expenses were up 7% due mainly to higher legal and infrastructure costs that were partially offset by lower restructuring costs.",
      "Family of Apps operating income was $17.7 billion, representing a 49% operating margin.",
      "Within our Reality Labs segment, Q1 revenue was $440 million, up 30% driven by Quest headset sales.",
      "Reality Labs expenses were $4.3 billion, down 1% year-over-year as higher headcount-related expenses were more than offset by lapping inventory-related valuation adjustments and restructuring costs.",
      "There are two primary factors that drive our revenue performance: Our ability to deliver engaging experiences for our community, and our effectiveness at monetizing that engagement over time.",
      "On the first - we remain pleased with engagement trends and have strong momentum across our product priorities.",
      "Our investments in developing increasingly advanced recommendation systems continue to drive incremental engagement on our platforms, demonstrating that people are finding added value by discovering content from accounts they’re not connected to.",
      "The level of recommended content in our apps has scaled as we’ve improved these systems, and we see further opportunity to increase the relevance and personalization of recommendations as we advance our models.",
      "Video also continues to grow across our platform, and it now represents more than 60% of time on both Facebook and Instagram.",
      "Reels remains the primary driver of that growth, and we’re progressing on our work to bring together Reels, longer-form video and Live video into one experience on Facebook.",
      "In April, we rolled out this unified video experience in the US and Canada, which is increasingly powered by our next generation ranking architecture that we expect will help deliver more relevant video recommendations over time.",
      "We’re also introducing deeper integrations of generative AI into our apps in the US and more than a dozen other countries.",
      "Along with using Meta AI within our chat surfaces, people will now be able to use Meta AI in Search within our apps, as well as Feed and Groups on Facebook.",
      "We expect these integrations will complement our social discovery strategy as our recommendation systems help people to discover and explore their interests while Meta AI enables them to dive deeper on topics they’re interested in.",
      "Threads also continues to see good traction as we continue to ship valuable features and scale the community.",
      "Now to the second driver of our revenue performance: increasing monetization efficiency.",
      "The first is optimizing the level of ads within organic engagement.",
      "Here, we continue to advance our understanding of users’ preferences for viewing ads to more effectively optimize the right time, place and person to show an ad to.",
      "For example, we are getting better at adjusting the placement and number of ads in real time, based on our perception of a user’s interest in ad content and to minimize disruption from ads, as well as innovating on new and creative ad formats.",
      "We expect to continue that work going forward, while surfaces with relatively lower levels of monetization, like video and messaging, will serve as additional growth opportunities.",
      "The second part of improving monetization efficiency is enhancing marketing performance.",
      "Similar to our work with organic recommendations, AI is playing an increasing role in these efforts.",
      "First, we are making ongoing ads modeling improvements that are delivering better performance for advertisers.",
      "One example is our new ads ranking architecture, Meta Lattice, which we began rolling out more broadly last year.",
      "This new architecture allows us to run significantly larger models that generalize learnings across objectives and surfaces in place of numerous, smaller ads models that have historically been optimized for individual objectives and surfaces.",
      "This is not only leading to increased efficiency as we operate fewer models, but also improving ad performance.",
      "Another way we’re leveraging AI is to provide increased automation for advertisers.",
      "Through our Advantage+ portfolio, advertisers can automate one step of the campaign set up process - such as selecting which ad creative to show - or automate their campaign completely using our end-to-end automation tools, Advantage+ Shopping and Advantage+ App ads.",
      "We’re seeing growing use of these solutions, and we expect to drive further adoption over the course of the year while applying what we learn to our broader ads investments.",
      "Next, I’d like to discuss our approach to capital allocation.",
      "We continue to see compelling investment opportunities to both improve our core business in the near- term and capture significant longer-term opportunities in generative AI and Reality Labs.",
      "As we develop more advanced and compute-intensive recommendation models and scale capacity for our generative AI training and inference needs, we expect that having sufficient infrastructure capacity will be critical to realizing many of these opportunities.",
      "As a result, we expect that we will invest significantly more in infrastructure over the coming years.",
      "Our other long-term initiative that we're continuing to make significant investments in is Reality Labs.",
      "We are also starting to see our AI initiatives increasingly overlap with our Reality Labs work.",
      "For example, with RayBan Meta smart glasses, people in the US & Canada can now use our multimodal Meta AI assistant for daily tasks without pulling out their phone.",
      "Longer-term, we expect generative AI to play an increasing role in our mixed reality products, making it easier to develop immersive experiences.",
      "Accelerating our AI efforts will help ensure we can provide the best version of our services as we transition to the next computing platform.",
      "We expect to pursue these opportunities while maintaining a focus on operating discipline, and believe our strong financial position will allow us to support these investments while also returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.",
      "In addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the US that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.",
      "We also have a jury trial scheduled for June in a suit brought by the State of Texas regarding our use of facial recognition technology, which could ultimately result in a material loss.",
      "We expect second quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $36.5-39 billion.",
      "Our guidance assumes foreign currency is a 1% headwind to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates.",
      "We expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96-99 billion, updated from our prior outlook of $94-99 billion due to higher infrastructure and legal costs.",
      "For Reality Labs, we continue to expect operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and our investments to further scale our ecosystem.",
      "We anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $35-40 billion, increased from our prior range of $30-37 billion as we continue to accelerate our infrastructure investments to support our AI roadmap.",
      "While we are not providing guidance for years beyond 2024, we expect capex will continue to increase next year as we invest aggressively to support our ambitious AI research and product development efforts.",
      "Absent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our full-year 2024 tax rate to be in the mid-teens.",
      "In closing, Q1 was a good start to the year.",
      "We’re seeing strong momentum within our Family of Apps and are making important progress on our longer-term AI and Reality Labs initiatives that have the potential to transform the way people interact with our services over the coming years.",

      "In terms of the timing, I think it's somewhat difficult to extrapolate from previous cycles.",

      "So while it's still too early to share specific results, we're optimistic that the new model architecture will unlock increasingly relevant video recommendations over time.",
      "And if it's successful, we'll explore using it to power other recommendations.",
      "An analog exists, I would say, on the ads side.",
      "We've talked a little bit about the new model architecture, Meta Lattice, that we deployed last year that consolidates smaller and more specialized models into larger models that can better learn what characteristics improve ad performance across multiple services, like Feed and Reels and multiple types of ads and objectives at the same time.",
      "And that's driven improved ad performance over the course of 2023 as we deployed it across Facebook and Instagram to support multiple objectives.",

      "So there's a lot of work that we're investing in, in the underlying model architecture for both organic engagement and ads that we expect is going to continue to deliver increasing ads performance over time.",
      "The second question you asked was around getting advertisers to test and adopt GenAI tools.",
      "The more near-term version is around the GenAI ad creative features that we have put into our ads creation tools.",
      "And it's early, but we're seeing adoption of these features across verticals and different advertiser sizes.",
      "In particular, we've seen outsized adoption of image expansion with small businesses, and this will remain a big area of focus for us in 2024, and I expect that improvements to our underlying foundation models will enhance the quality of the outputs that are generated and support new features on the roadmap.",
      "But right now we have features supporting text variations, image expansion, and background generation, and we're continuing to work to make those more performant for advertisers to create more personalized ads at scale.",
      "The longer-term piece here is around business AIs.",
      "We have been testing the ability for businesses to set up AIs for business messaging that represent them in chats with customers, starting by supporting shopping use cases such as responding to people asking for more information on a product or its availability.",
      "We've been testing this with a handful of businesses on Messenger and WhatsApp, and we're hearing good feedback with businesses saying that the AIs have saved them significant time while customer -- consumers noted more timely response times.",
      "And we're also learning a lot from these tests to make these AIs more performant over time as well.",
      "So, we'll be expanding these tests over the coming months, and we'll continue to take our time here to get it right before we make it more broadly available."

      "So we're going to continue to look for opportunities to thoughtfully grow it in the future and invest in creative ways to address the structural supply constraints of the Reels format being more video-heavy including higher density experiences and formats and increasingly personalizing ad loads, which we think will make sure that we're really putting ads in front of people when they're most likely to be interested and engaged with them.",

      "Now we did see strength across other geographies as well including a 6-point acceleration in total revenue growth from North America advertisers.",

      "If you're a business, you have a goal, right?",
      "well and you're trying to position your products in a certain way and encourage people to buy certain things that map to their interests and what they’d be interested in.",
      "And that's more of like a multiturn interaction, right?",
      "So the type of business agent that you're going to be able to enable with just a chatbot is going to be very naive compared to what we're going to have in a year even, but beyond that, too, is just the reasoning and planning abilities if these things grow to be able to just help guide people through the business process of engaging with whatever your goals are as a creator or a business.",
      "So I think that that's going to be extremely powerful.",
      "And I think the opportunity is really big.",
      "So -- and on top of that, I think what we've shown now is that we have the ability to build leading models in our company.",
      "So I think it makes sense to go for it, and we're going to.",
      "And I think it's going to be a really good long-term investment.",
      "But I did just want to spell out on this call today, the extent to which we're focusing on this and investing in this for the long term because that's what we do."

      "We've had a strong start to the year.",
      "Our community keeps growing with more than 3.4 billion people now using at least one of our apps each day.",
      "Our business is also performing very well -- and I think we're well-positioned to navigate the macro economic uncertainty.",
      "The major theme right now of course is how AI is transforming everything we do.",
      "And as we continue to increase our investments and focus more of our resources on AI, I thought it would be useful today to lay out the five major opportunities that we're focused on: improved advertising, more engaging experiences, business messaging, Meta AI, and AI devices.",
      "These are each long term investments that are downstream from us building general intelligence and leading AI models and infrastructure.",
      "Even with our significant investments, we don't need to succeed in all of these areas to have a good ROI.",
      "But if we do, then I think that we will be wildly happy with the investments that we’re making.",
      "Our goal is to make it so that any business can basically tell us what objective they're trying to achieve -- like selling something or getting a new customer -- and how much they're willing to pay for each result, and then we just do the rest.",
      "Businesses used to have to generate their own ad creative and define what audiences they wanted to reach.",
      "But AI has already made us better at targeting and finding the audiences that will be interested in their product than many businesses are themselves, and that keeps improving.",
      "And now AI is generating better creative options for many businesses as well.",
      "I think that this is really redefining what advertising is into an AI agent that delivers measurable business results at scale.",
      "And if we deliver on this vision, then over the coming years I think that the increased productivity from AI will make advertising a meaningfully larger share of global GDP than it is today.",
      "In just the last quarter, we're testing a new ads recommendation model for Reels, which has already increased conversion rates by 5%.",
      "And we’re seeing 30% more advertisers are using AI creative tools in the last quarter as well.",
      "This will come in two forms: better recommendations for existing content types, and better, new types of content.",
      "In the last six months, improvements to our recommendation systems have led to a 7% increase in time spent on Facebook, 6% increase on Instagram, and 35% on Threads.",
      "Threads now also has more than 350 million monthly actives and continues to be on track to become our next major social app.",
      "In addition to better recommendations for existing content types, AI is also enabling the creation of better content as well.",
      "Some of this will be helping people produce better content to share themselves.",
      "Some of this will be AI generating content directly for people that is personalized for them.",
      "Some of this will be in existing formats like photos and videos, and some of this will be increasingly interactive.",
      "I've often talked about this long term trend of content becoming richer over time.",
      "Our feeds started mostly with text, and then became mostly photos when we all got mobile phones with cameras, and then became mostly video when mobile networks became fast enough to handle that well.",
      "We're now in the video era, but I don't think that this is s the end of the line.",
      "In the near future I think we're going to have content in our feeds that you can interact with and it'll interact back with rather than you just watching it.",
      "Over the long term, as AI unlocks more productivity in the economy, I also expect that people will spend more of their time on entertainment and culture, which will create an even larger opportunity to create more engaging experiences across all of these apps.",
      "Right now the vast majority of our business is advertising in feeds on Facebook and Instagram.",
      "But WhatsApp now has more than 3 billion monthly actives, with more than 100 million people in the US and growing quickly there.",
      "Messenger is also used by more than a billion people each month, and there are now as many messages sent each day on Instagram as there are on Messenger.",
      "Business messaging should be the next pillar of our business.",
      "In countries like Thailand and Vietnam where there is a low cost of labor, we see many businesses conduct commerce through our messaging apps.",
      "There is actually so much business through messaging that those countries are both in our top 10 or 11 by revenue even though they're ranked in the 30s in global GDP.",
      "This phenomenon hasn't yet spread to developed countries because the cost of labor is too high to make this a profitable model before AI -- but AI should solve this.",
      "In the next few years, I expect that just like every business has an email address, social media account, and website, they'll also have an AI business agent for customer support and sales.",
      "And they should be able to set that up very easily given all the context they've already put into our business platforms.",
      "We’re going to have more to share on upcoming calls about our progress in this area.",
      "Across our apps, there are now almost a billion monthly actives using Meta AI.",
      "Our focus for this year is deepening the experience and making Meta AI the leading personal AI -- with an emphasis on personalization, voice conversations, and entertainment.",
      "I think that we're all going to have an AI that we talk to throughout the day -- while we're browsing content on our phones, and eventually as we're going through our days with glasses -- and I think this will be one of the most important and valuable services that has ever been created.",
      "In addition to building Meta AI into our apps, we just released our first Meta AI standalone app.",
      "It's personalized so you can talk to it about interests you've shown while browsing Reels or different content across our apps.",
      "And we built a social feed so you can discover entertaining ways that others are using Meta AI, and initial feedback has been good so far.",
      "Over time, I expect the business opportunity for Meta AI to follow our normal product development playbook.",
      "First we build and scale a product, and then once it's at scale then we focus on revenue.",
      "In this case, I think there will be a large opportunity to show product recommendations or ads, as well as a premium service for people who want to unlock more compute for additional functionality or intelligence.",
      "But I expect that we're going to be largely focused on scaling and deepening engagement for at least the next year before we'll really be ready to start building out the business here.",
      "The fifth opportunity is AI devices, which is increasingly how we're thinking about our work on the next generation of computing platforms.",
      "Glasses are the ideal form factor for both AI and the metaverse.",
      "They enable you to let an AI see what you see, hear what you hear, and talk to you throughout the day.",
      "And they let you blend the physical and digital worlds together with holograms.",
      "More than a billion people worldwide wear glasses today, and it seems highly likely that these will become AI glasses over the next 5 to 10 years.",
      "Building the devices that people use to experience our services lets us deliver the highest quality AI and social experiences.",
      "This will serve as an amplifier on all the opportunities I mentioned so far, as well as unlocking some new opportunities as well.",
      "Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses have tripled in sales in the last year and people who have them are using them a lot.",
      "We've got some exciting new launches with our partner EssilorLuxottica later this year as well that should expand that category and add some new technological capabilities to the glasses.",
      "On Quest, we're also seeing deeper engagement as Quest 3S makes VR accessible to more people, and more people are creating experiences in Horizon with AI tools.",
      "Everything that I've talked about today is built on top of our AI models and our infrastructure.",
      "We released the first Llama 4 models earlier this month -- and they are some of the most intelligent, best multi-modal, lowest latency, and most-efficient models that anyone has built.",
      "We have more models on the way, including the massive Llama 4 Behemoth model.",
      "Overall, we are focused on building full general intelligence.",
      "All of the opportunities that I've discussed today are downstream of delivering general intelligence and doing so efficiently.",
      "The pace of progress across the industry and the opportunities ahead for us are staggering.",
      "I want to make sure that we're working aggressively and efficiently, and I also want to make sure that we are building out the leading infrastructure and teams we need to achieve our goals.",
      "To that end, we're accelerating some of our efforts to bring capacity online more quickly this year as well as some longer term projects that will give us the flexibility to add capacity in the coming years as well.",
      "And that has increased our planned investment for this year.",
      "More broadly, this has been a good start to what I expect will continue to be an intense year.",
      "We've got a lot more exciting work in the pipeline that I'm looking forward to sharing soon.",
      "I continue to think that this year is going to be a pivotal moment for our industry.",
      "I'm grateful for everyone who is working so hard at the company to deliver all this amazing technology and new experiences.",
      "As always, thank you for being on this journey with us, and now, here’s Susan."

      "Q1 total revenue was $42.3 billion, up 16% or 19% on a constant currency basis.",
      "Q1 total expenses were $24.8 billion, up 9% compared to last year.",
      "In terms of the specific line items: Cost of revenue increased 14%, driven primarily by higher infrastructure costs and payments to partners, partially offset by a benefit from the previously announced extension of server useful lives.",
      "R&D increased 22%, mostly due to higher employee compensation and infrastructure costs.",
      "Marketing & Sales increased 8%, driven mainly by an increase in professional services related to our ongoing platform integrity efforts.",
      "G&A decreased 34% driven primarily by lower legal-related costs.",
      "We ended Q1 with over 76,800 employees, up 4% quarter-over-quarter.",
      "First quarter operating income was $17.6 billion, representing a 41% operating margin.",
      "Our tax rate for the quarter was 9%, as we recognized excess tax benefits from share based compensation due to the increase in our share price versus prior periods.",
      "Net income was $16.6 billion or $6.43 per share.",
      "Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $13.7 billion, driven by investments in servers, data centers and network infrastructure.",
      "We repurchased $13.4 billion of our Class A common stock and paid $1.3 billion in dividends to shareholders, ending the quarter with $70.2 billion in cash and marketable securities and $28.8 billion in debt.",
      "I’ll begin with our Family of Apps segment.",
      "Our community across the Family of Apps continues to grow, and we estimate more than 3.4 billion people used at least one of our Family of Apps on a daily basis in March.",
      "Q1 Total Family of Apps revenue was $41.9 billion, up 16% year over year.",
      "Q1 Family of Apps ad revenue was $41.4 billion, up 16% or 20% on a constant currency basis.",
      "Within ad revenue, the online commerce vertical was the largest contributor to year-over-year growth.",
      "On a user geography basis, ad revenue growth was strongest in Rest of World and North America at 19% and 18%, respectively.",
      "In Q1, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 5% and the average price per ad increased 10%.",
      "Pricing growth benefited from increased advertiser demand, in part driven by improved ad performance.",
      "This was partially offset by impression growth, particularly from lower-monetizing regions and surfaces.",
      "Family of Apps other revenue was $510 million, up 34%, driven mostly by business messaging revenue growth from our WhatsApp Business Platform as well as Meta Verified subscriptions.",
      "We continue to direct the majority of our investments toward the development and operation of our Family of Apps.",
      "In Q1, Family of Apps expenses were $20.1 billion, representing 81% of our overall expenses.",
      "Family of Apps expenses were up 10%, mainly due to growth in employee compensation and infrastructure costs, which were partially offset by lower legal-related expenses.",
      "Family of Apps operating income was $21.8 billion, representing a 52% operating margin.",
      "Within our Reality Labs segment, Q1 revenue was $412 million, down 6% year-over-year due to lower Meta Quest sales, which were partially offset by increased sales of Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses.",
      "Reality Labs expenses were $4.6 billion, up 8% year-over-year driven primarily by higher employee compensation.",
      "There are two primary factors that drive our revenue performance: our ability to deliver engaging experiences for our community, and our effectiveness at monetizing that engagement over time.",
      "On the first, we’re focused both on enhancing our core Family of Apps today and building the next generation of devices and experiences through Reality Labs.",
      "In the first quarter, we saw strong growth in video consumption across both Facebook and Instagram, particularly in the US where video time spent grew double digits year-over-year.",
      "This growth continues to be driven primarily by ongoing enhancements to our recommendation systems, and we see opportunities to deliver further gains this year.",
      "We’re also progressing on longer-term efforts to develop innovative new approaches to recommendations.",
      "A big focus of this work will be on developing increasingly efficient recommendation systems so that we can continue scaling up the complexity and compute used to train our models while avoiding diminishing returns.",
      "There are promising techniques we’re working on that will incorporate the innovations from LLM model architectures to achieve this.",
      "Another area that is showing early promise is integrating LLM technology into our content recommendations systems.",
      "For example, we’re finding that LLMs’ ability to understand a piece of content more deeply than traditional recommendation systems can help better identify what is interesting to someone about a piece of content, leading to better recommendations.",
      "We began testing using Llama in Threads recommendation systems at the end of last year given the app’s text-based content, and have already seen a 4% lift in time spent from the first launch.",
      "It remains early here, but a big focus this year will be on exploring how we can deploy this for other content types, including photos and videos.",
      "We also expect this to be complimentary to Meta AI as it can provide more relevant responses to people’s queries by better understanding their interests and preferences through their interactions across Facebook, Instagram, and Threads.",
      "Earlier this year, we began testing the ability for Meta AI to better personalize its responses by remembering certain details from people’s prior queries and considering what that person engages with on our apps.",
      "We are already seeing this lead to deeper engagement with people we’ve rolled it out to, and it is now built into Meta AI across Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and our new standalone Meta AI app in the US and Canada.",
      "We’re also continuing to focus on helping people connect over content.",
      "In Q1, we launched a new experience on Instagram in the US that consists of a Feed of content your friends have left a note on or liked, and we’re seeing good results.",
      "We also just launched Blend, which is an opt-in experience in direct messages that enables you to blend your Reels algorithm with your friends to spark conversations over each other’s interests.",
      "These features all lean into Instagram’s position at the intersection of entertainment and social connection.",
      "WhatsApp remains at its core a private messaging app, but it has evolved to also become a place people come to get updates from accounts they are connected to or follow.",
      "Today, there are tens of billions of views of Status posts on WhatsApp each day, and we continue to invest in the Updates tab as a place people can go to do more.",
      "Creators remain another big focus for us, and we’re investing in tools to help them produce the best original content on our platforms.",
      "Last week, we launched our standalone Edits app, which supports the full creative process for video creators - from inspiration and creation to performance insights.",
      "Edits has an ultra-high resolution short-form video camera and includes generative AI tools that enable people to remove the background of any video or animate still images, with more features coming soon.",
      "We’re seeing very strong traction with Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses, with over 4x as many monthly actives as a year ago, and the number of people using voice commands is growing even faster as people use it to answer questions and control their glasses.",
      "This month, we fully rolled out live translations on Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses to all markets for English, French, Italian, and Spanish.",
      "Now, when you are speaking to someone in one of these languages, you’ll hear what they say in your preferred language through the glasses in real time.",
      "Now to the second driver of our revenue performance: increasing monetization efficiency.",
      "The first part of this work is optimizing the level of ads within organic engagement.",
      "We continue to optimize ad supply across each surface to better deliver ads at the time and place they are most relevant to people.",
      "We are also starting to introduce ads on unmonetized surfaces, like Threads, which we opened up to all eligible advertisers this month to reach people in over 30 different markets to start, including the US.",
      "As we do for any newly monetized surface, we expect to gradually ramp ad supply as we optimize the ad formats and ensure they feel native to the app.",
      "We don’t expect Threads to be a meaningful driver of overall impression or revenue growth in 2025.",
      "The second part of increasing monetization efficiency is improving marketing performance.",
      "We’re continuing to improve our ads systems by developing new modeling technologies to more efficiently predict the right ad to show.",
      "In Q1, we introduced our new Generative Ads Recommendation model, or GEM, for ads ranking.",
      "This model uses a new architecture we developed that is twice as efficient at improving ad performance for a given amount of data and compute.",
      "This efficiency gain enabled us to significantly scale up the amount of compute we use for model training, with GEM trained on thousands of GPUs, our largest cluster for ads training to date.",
      "We began testing the new model for ads recommendations on Facebook Reels earlier this year and have seen up to a 5% increase in ad conversions.",
      "We’re now rolling it out to additional surfaces across our apps.",
      "On the ads product side, we’re seeing continued momentum with our Advantage+ suite of AI- powered solutions.",
      "We’ve been encouraged by the initial tests of our streamlined campaign creation flow for Sales, app and lead campaigns, which starts with Advantage+ turned on from the beginning for advertisers.",
      "In April, we rolled this out to more advertisers and expect to complete the global roll out later this year.",
      "We’re also seeing strong adoption of Advantage+ creative.",
      "This week, we are broadening access of Video Expansion to Facebook Reels for all eligible advertisers, enabling them to automatically adjust the aspect ratio of their existing videos by generating new pixels in each frame to optimize their ads for full screen surfaces.",
      "We also rolled out image generation to all eligible advertisers and this quarter we plan to continue testing a new virtual try-on feature that uses genAI to place clothing on virtual models, helping customers visualize how an item may look and fit.",
      "Last, we continue to evolve our ads platform to drive results that are optimized for each business’ objectives and the way they measure value.",
      "One example of this is our Incremental Attribution feature, which enables advertisers to optimize for driving incremental conversions, or conversions we believe would not have occurred without an ad being shown.",
      "We’re seeing strong results in testing so far, with advertisers using Incremental Attribution in tests seeing an average 46% lift in incremental conversions compared to their business-as-usual approach.",
      "We expect to make this available to all advertisers in the coming weeks.",
      "Next, I would like to discuss our approach to capital allocation.",
      "Our primary focus remains investing capital back into the business, with infrastructure and talent being our top priorities.",
      "Our hiring continues to be targeted at technical roles within our company priorities.",
      "In the first quarter, the significant majority of the roughly 2,800 employees we added were to support our priorities of monetization, infrastructure, generative AI, regulation and compliance, and Reality Labs.",
      "On infrastructure, we have two primary focuses to meet the growing compute needs of our services and AI initiatives.",
      "The first way is by significantly scaling up our infrastructure footprint.",
      "Our capex growth this year is going toward both generative AI and core business needs, with the majority of overall capex supporting the core.",
      "We expect the significant infrastructure footprint we’re building will not only help us meet the demands of our business in the near-term, but also provide us an advantage in the quality and scale of AI services we can deliver.",
      "We continue to build this capacity in a way that grants us maximum flexibility in how and when we deploy it to ensure we have the agility to react to how the technology and industry develop in the coming years.",
      "The second way we’re meeting our compute needs is by increasing the efficiency of our workloads.",
      "In fact, many of the innovations coming out of our ranking work are focused on increasing the efficiency of our systems.",
      "This emphasis on efficiency is helping us deliver consistently strong returns from our core AI initiatives.",
      "For example, we shared on the Q3 2024 call that improvements to our AI-driven Feed and video recommendations drove a roughly 8% lift in time spent on Facebook and a 6% lift on Instagram over the first 9 months of last year.",
      "Since then, we’ve been able to deliver similar gains in just six months time, with improvements to our AI recommendations delivering 7% and 6% time spent gains on Facebook and Instagram, respectively.",
      "Before moving to our financial guidance, I want to acknowledge the dynamic macro environment and note that our range reflects the potential for a wider set of outcomes.",
      "We continue to feel good about the fundamental drivers of revenue growth and believe the past work we’ve done to streamline our operations and cost profile puts us in a strong position to navigate a variety of outcomes.",
      "We expect second quarter 2025 total revenue to be in the range of $42.5-45.5 billion.",
      "Our guidance assumes foreign currency is an approximately 1% tailwind to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates.",
      "We expect full year 2025 total expenses to be in the range of $113-118 billion, lowered from our prior outlook of $114-119 billion.",
      "We anticipate our full year 2025 capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, will be in the range of $64-72 billion, increased from our prior outlook of $60-65 billion.",
      "This updated outlook reflects additional data center investments to support our AI efforts as well as an increase in the expected cost of infrastructure hardware.",
      "The majority of our capex in 2025 will continue to be directed to our core business.",
      "Absent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our full year 2025 tax rate to be in the range of 12-15%.",
      "In addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the US that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.",
      "The European Commission recently announced its decision that our subscription for no ads model is not compliant with the DMA.",
      "Based on feedback from the European Commission in connection with the DMA, we expect we will need to make some modifications to our model, which could result in a materially worse user experience for European users and a significant impact to our European business and revenue as early as the third quarter of 2025.",
      "We will appeal the Commission's DMA decision but any modifications to our model may be imposed before or during the appeal process.",
      "In closing, this was another solid quarter for our business.",
      "We believe the investments we’re making across our company priorities will position us well in the coming years to continue delivering engaging services for our community, compelling results for advertisers, and strong business performance.",
      "With that, Krista, let’s open up the call for questions."

      "So to that end, Llama 4, the shape of the model with 17 billion parameters per expert was designed specifically for the infrastructure that we have in order to provide the low latency experience to be voice optimized.",
      "One of the key things, if you’re having a voice conversation with AI is it needs to be low latency.",

      "And part of the reason why we think that that’s important is because we’re very focused on providing a personalized experience.",
      "And there are different ways that you can put personalization context into an LLM, but one of the ways to do it is to include some of that context in the context window.",
      "And having a long context window that can incorporate a lot of the background that the person has shared across our apps is one way to do that.",
      "So that’s like -- it kind of is giving you a flavor of the products that we’re trying to build and then some specific technical architecture decisions and research prioritization that we basically have made in order to deliver the specific experience that we’re going for.",

      "The reason I think it’s also very important to deliver big models like Behemoth, not because we’re going to end up serving them in production, but because of the technique of distilling from larger models, right.",
      "The Llama 4 models that we’ve published so far and the ones that we’re using internally and some of the ones that we’ll build in the future, are basically distilled from the Behemoth model in order to get the 90%, 95% of the intelligence of the large model in a form factor that is much lower latency and much more efficient.",
      "Obviously we wouldn’t be able to do that kind of distillation from other closed models.",

      "And hey everyone -- thanks for joining today.",
      "This was a strong quarter for our community and business.",
      "We estimate that there are now more than 3.2 billion people using at least one of our apps each day.",
      "The growth we're seeing here in the US has especially been a bright spot.",
      "WhatsApp now serves more than 100 million monthly actives in the US, and we're seeing good year-over-year growth across Facebook, Instagram, and Threads as well -- both in the US and globally.",
      "I'm particularly pleased with the progress that we're making with young adults on Facebook.",
      "The numbers we're seeing, especially in the US, really go against the public narrative around who's using the app.",
      "A couple of years ago we started focusing our apps more on 18-29 year olds, and it's good to see that those efforts are driving good results.",
      "Another bright spot is Threads, which is about to hit 200 million monthly actives.",
      "We're making steady progress towards building what looks like it’s going to be another major social app.",
      "and I'm quite pleased with the trajectory here.",
      "The big theme right now is of course AI, and I'll focus my comments today on three areas: what AI means for our family of apps and core business, what new AI experiences and opportunities we see, and how AI is shaping our metaverse work.",
      "So, let’s start: across Facebook and Instagram, advances in AI continue to improve the quality of recommendations and drive engagement.",
      "We keep finding that as we develop more general recommendation models, content recommendations get better.",
      "This quarter we rolled out our full-screen video player and unified video recommendation service across Facebook -- bringing Reels, longer videos, and Live into a single experience.",
      "This has allowed us to extend our unified AI systems, which had already increased engagement on Facebook Reels more than our initial move from CPUs to GPUs did.",
      "Over time, I'd like to see us move towards a single, unified recommendation system that powers all of the content including things like People You May Know across all of our surfaces.",
      "We're not there, so there's still upside -- and we're making good progress here.",
      "AI is also going to significantly evolve our services for advertisers in some exciting ways.",
      "It used to be that advertisers came to us with a specific audience they wanted to reach -- like a certain age group, geography, or interests.",
      "Eventually we got to the point where our ads system could better predict who would be interested than the advertisers could themselves.",
      "But today advertisers still need to develop creative themselves.",
      "In the coming years, AI will be able to generate creative for advertisers as well -- and will also be able to personalize it as people see it.",
      "Over the long term, advertisers will basically just be able to tell us a business objective and a budget, and we're going to go do the rest for them.",
      "We're going to get there incrementally over time, but I think this is going to be a very big deal.",
      "Moving onto some of the brand new experiences that AI enables, last quarter we started broadly rolling out our assistant, Meta AI, and it is on track to achieve our goal of becoming the most used AI assistant by the end of the year.",
      "We have an exciting roadmap ahead of things that we want to add, but the bottom line here is that Meta AI feels on track to be an important service and it's improving quickly both in intelligence and features.",
      "Some of the use cases are utilitarian, like searching for information or role-playing difficult conversations before you have them with another person, and other uses are more creative, like the new Imagine Yourself feature that lets you create images of yourself doing whatever you want in whatever style you want.",
      "And part of the beauty of AI is that it's general, so we're still uncovering the wide range of use cases that it's valuable for.",
      "An important part of our vision is that we're not just creating a single AI, but enabling lots of people to create their own AIs.",
      "This week we launched AI Studio, which lets anyone create AIs to interact with across our apps.",
      "I think that creators are especially going to find this quite valuable.",
      "There are millions of creators across our apps -- and these are people who want to engage more with their communities and their communities want to engage more with them -- but there are only so many hours in the day.",
      "So now they’re going to be able to use AI Studio to create AI agents that can channel them to chat with their community, answer people’s questions, create content, and more.",
      "Anyone is going to be able to build their own AIs based on their interests or different topics that they are going to be able to engage with or share with their friends.",
      "Business AIs are the other big piece here.",
      "We're still in alpha testing with more and more businesses.",
      "The feedback we're getting is positive so far.",
      "Over time I think that just like every business has a website, a social media presence, and an email address, in the future I think that every business is also going to have an AI agent that their customers can interact with.",
      "Our goal is to make it easy for every small business, and eventually every business, to pull all of their content and catalog into an AI agent that drives sales and saves them money.",
      "When this is working at scale, I think that this is going to dramatically accelerate our business messaging revenue.",
      "There are a lot of other new opportunities here that I'm excited about too, but I'll save those for another day when we're ready to roll them out.",
      "The engine that powers all these new experiences is the Llama family of foundation models.",
      "This quarter we released Llama 3.1, which includes the first frontier-level open source model, as well as new and industry-leading small and medium-sized models.",
      "The 405B model has better cost performance relative to the leading closed models, and because it's open, it is immediately the best choice for fine-tuning and distilling your own custom models of whatever size you need.",
      "I think we're going to look back at Llama 3.1 as an inflection point in the industry where open source AI started to become the industry standard, just like Linux is.",
      "I often get asked why I'm so bullish on open source.",
      "I wrote a letter along with the Llama 3.1 release explaining why I believe that open source is better for developers, for Meta, and for the world more broadly.",
      "My view is that open source will be safer, will enable innovation that improves all of our lives faster, and will also create more shared prosperity.",
      "For Meta's own interests, we're in the business of building the best consumer and advertiser experiences.",
      "To do that, we need to have access to the leading technology infrastructure and not get constrained by what competitors will let us do.",
      "But these models are ecosystems, they’re not just isolated pieces of software that we can develop by ourselves.",
      "So if we want the most robust ecosystem of tools, efficiency improvements, silicon optimizations, and other integrations to develop around our models, then we need them to be widely used by developers across the industry.",
      "Once we know that we’re going to have access to the leading models, then I am confident that we’re going to be able to build the best social and advertising experiences.",
      "Part of why I'm so optimistic about this is that we have a long track record of success with open source.",
      "We've saved billions of dollars with Open Compute Project by having supply chains standardize on our infra designs.",
      "Open sourcing tools like PyTorch and React has led to real benefits for us from all of the industry's contributions.",
      "This approach has consistently worked for us, and I expect it will work here too.",
      "Another major area of focus is figuring out the right level of infra capacity to support training more and more advanced models.",
      "Llama 3 is already competitive with the most advanced models, and we're already starting to work on Llama 4, which we're aiming to be the most advanced in the industry next year.",
      "We're planning for the compute clusters and data we'll need for the next several years.",
      "The amount of compute needed to train Llama 4 will likely be almost 10x more than what we used to train Llama 3 -- and future models will continue to grow beyond that.",
      "It's hard to predict how this will trend multiple generations out into the future, but at this point I'd rather risk building capacity before it is needed, rather than too late, given the long lead times for spinning up new infra projects.",
      "And as we scale these investments, we're of course going to remain committed to operational efficiency across the company.",
      "The last area that I want to discuss is how AI is shaping our metaverse work, which continues to be our other long-term focus.",
      "Last quarter I discussed how advances in AI have pulled in the timelines for some of our products.",
      "A few years ago I would have predicted that holographic AR would be possible before smart AI, but now it looks like those technologies will actually be ready in the opposite order.",
      "We're well-positioned for that because of the Reality Labs investments that we've already made.",
      "Ray-Ban Meta glasses continue to be a bigger hit sooner than we expected -- thanks in part to AI.",
      "Demand is still outpacing our ability to build them, but I'm hopeful that we'll be able to meet that demand soon.",
      "EssilorLuxottica has been a great partner to work with on this, and we're excited to team up with them to build future generations of AI glasses as we continue to build our long term partnership.",
      "Quest 3 sales are also outpacing our expectations -- and I think that's because it's not just the best MR headset for the price, but it’s the best headset on the market, period.",
      "In addition to gaming, people are increasingly taking advantage of Quest's capabilities as a general computing platform, spending time watching videos, browsing websites, extending their PC via virtual desktop, and more.",
      "Horizon also continues to grow across VR, mobile, and desktop -- and I expect that it will become an increasingly important part of that ecosystem as well.",
      "We're hosting our annual Connect conference on September 25, and we'll have lots of exciting updates around all of our AI and metaverse work -- so I encourage you to tune in to that.",
      "At the end of the day, we are in the fortunate position where the strong results we're seeing in our core products and business gives us the opportunity to make deep investments for the future -- and I plan to fully seize that opportunity to build some amazing things that will pay off for our community and our investors for decades to come.",
      "The progress we're making on both the foundational technology and product experiences suggests that we're on the right track.",
      "I'm proud of what our team has accomplished so far and I'm optimistic about our ability to execute on the opportunities ahead.",
      "As always, thank you to our teams who are pushing all of this important work forward, and thanks to all of you for being on this journey with us."

      "Our community across the Family of Apps continues to grow, with approximately 3.27 billion people using at least one of our Family of Apps on a daily basis in June.",
      "Q2 Total Family of Apps revenue was $38.7 billion, up 22% year over year.",
      "Q2 Family of Apps ad revenue was $38.3 billion, up 22% or 23% on a constant currency basis.",
      "Within ad revenue, the online commerce vertical was the largest contributor to year-over-year growth, followed by gaming and entertainment and media.",
      "On a user geography basis, ad revenue growth was strongest in Rest of World and Europe at 33% and 26%, respectively.",
      "Asia-Pacific grew 20% and North America grew 17%.",
      "On an advertiser geography basis, total revenue growth continued to be strongest in Asia-Pacific at 28%, though growth was below the first quarter rate of 41% as we lapped a period of stronger demand from China-based advertisers.",
      "In Q2, the total number of ad impressions served across our services and the average price per ad both increased 10%.",
      "Impression growth was mainly driven by Asia-Pacific and Rest of World.",
      "Pricing growth was driven by increased advertiser demand, in part due to improved ad performance.",
      "This was partially offset by impression growth, particularly from lower-monetizing regions and surfaces.",
      "Family of Apps other revenue was $389 million, up 73%, driven primarily by business messaging revenue growth from our WhatsApp Business Platform.",
      "We continue to direct the majority of our investments toward the development and operation of our Family of Apps.",
      "In Q2, Family of Apps expenses were $19.4 billion, representing approximately 80% of our overall expenses.",
      "Family of Apps expenses were up 4%, mostly due to higher infrastructure and headcount-related expenses, which were partially offset by lower restructuring costs.",
      "Family of Apps operating income was $19.3 billion, representing a 50% operating margin.",
      "Within our Reality Labs segment, Q2 revenue was $353 million, up 28% driven primarily by Quest headset sales.",
      "Reality Labs expenses were $4.8 billion, up 21% year-over-year driven mainly by higher headcount-related expenses and Reality Labs inventory costs.",
      "There are two primary factors that drive our revenue performance: our ability to deliver engaging experiences for our community, and our effectiveness at monetizing that engagement over time.",
      "To deliver engaging experiences, we remain focused on executing our priorities, including video and in-feed recommendations.",
      "On Instagram, Reels engagement continues to grow as we make ongoing enhancements to our recommendations systems.",
      "Part of this work has been focused on increasing the share of original posts within recommendations so people can discover the best of Instagram, including content from emerging creators.",
      "Now, more than half of recommendations in the US come from original posts.",
      "On Facebook, we are seeing encouraging early results from the global roll-out of our unified video player and ranking systems in June.",
      "This initiative allows us to bring all video types on Facebook into one viewing experience, which we expect will unlock additional growth opportunities for short-form video as we increasingly mix shorter videos into the overall base of Facebook video engagement.",
      "We expect the relevance of video recommendations will continue to increase as we benefit from unifying video ranking across Facebook and integrating our next generation recommendation systems.",
      "These have already shown promising gains since we began using the new systems to support Facebook Reels recommendations last year.",
      "We expect to expand these new systems to support more surfaces beyond Facebook video over the course of this year and next year.",
      "We’re also seeing good momentum with our longer-term engagement priorities, including Generative AI and Threads.",
      "People have used Meta AI for billions of queries since we first introduced it.",
      "We’re seeing particularly promising signs on WhatsApp in terms of retention and engagement, which has coincided with India becoming our largest market for Meta AI usage.",
      "You can now use Meta AI in over 20 countries and eight languages, and in the US we’re rolling out new features like Imagine edit, which allows people to edit images they generate with Meta AI.",
      "Beyond generative AI, the Threads community also continues to grow and deepen their engagement as we ship new features and enhance our content recommendation systems.",
      "Now to the second driver of our revenue performance: increasing monetization efficiency.",
      "The first is optimizing the level of ads within organic engagement.",
      "We continue to see opportunities to grow ad supply on lower monetizing surfaces like video, including within Facebook as the mix of overall video engagement shifts more to shorter videos over time, which creates more ad insertion opportunities.",
      "More broadly, we are continuing to get better at determining the best ads to show and when to show them during a person’s session across both Facebook and Instagram.",
      "This is enabling us to drive revenue growth and conversions without increasing the number of ads or in some cases even reducing ad load.",
      "The second part of improving monetization efficiency is enhancing marketing performance.",
      "We continue to be pleased with progress here, with AI playing an increasingly central role.",
      "We’re improving ad delivery by adopting more sophisticated modeling techniques made possible by AI advancements, including our Meta Lattice ad ranking architecture, which continued to provide ad performance and efficiency gains in the second quarter.",
      "We’re also making it easier for advertisers to maximize ad performance and automate more of their campaign set up with our Advantage+ suite of solutions.",
      "We’re seeing these tools continue to unlock performance gains, with a study conducted this year demonstrating 22% higher return on ad spend for US advertisers after they adopted Advantage+ Shopping campaigns.",
      "Advertiser adoption of these tools continues to expand, and we’re adding new capabilities to make them even more useful.",
      "For example, this quarter we introduced Flexible Format to Advantage+ Shopping, which allows advertisers to upload multiple images and videos in a single ad that we can select from and automatically determine which format to serve, in order to yield the best performance.",
      "We have also now expanded the list of conversions that businesses can optimize for using Advantage+ Shopping to include an additional 10 conversion types, including objectives like “add to cart”.",
      "Looking forward, we believe generative AI will play a growing role in how businesses market and engage with customers at scale.",
      "We expect this technology will continue to make it easier for businesses to develop customized and diverse ad creative.",
      "We’ve seen promising early results since introducing our first generative AI ad features – image expansion, background generation, and text generation - with more than one million advertisers using at least one of these solutions in the past month.",
      "In May, we began rolling out full image generation capabilities into Advantage+ creative, and we’re already seeing improved performance from advertisers using the tool.",
      "Finally, we expect AI will help businesses communicate with customers more efficiently through messaging.",
      "We’re starting by testing the ability for businesses to use AI in their chats with customers to help sell their goods and services and to generate leads.",
      "While we are in the early stages, we continue to expand the number of advertisers we’re testing with and have seen good advances in the quality of responses since we began using Llama 3.",
      "Next, I would like to discuss our approach to capital allocation, which remains unchanged.",
      "We continue to invest both in enhancing our core experiences in the near-term and developing technologies that we believe will transform how people engage with our services in the years ahead.",
      "We expect that having sufficient compute capacity will be central to many of these opportunities, so we are investing meaningfully in infrastructure to support our core AI work, in content ranking and ads, as well as our generative AI and advanced research efforts.",
      "Our ongoing investment in core AI capacity is informed by the strong returns we’ve seen, and expect to deliver in the future, as we advance the relevance of recommended content and ads on our platforms.",
      "While we expect the returns from generative AI to come in over a longer period of time, we are mapping these investments against the significant monetization opportunities that we expect to be unlocked across customized ad creative, business messaging, a leading AI assistant, and organic content generation.",
      "As we scale generative AI training capacity to advance our foundation models, we will continue to build our infrastructure in a way that provides us with flexibility in how we use it over time.",
      "This will allow us to direct training capacity to gen AI inference, or to our core ranking and recommendation work when we expect that doing so would be more valuable.",
      "We will also continue our focus on improving the cost efficiency of our workloads over time.",
      "Reality Labs remains our other long-term initiative that we continue to invest meaningfully in.",
      "Quest 3 is selling well and Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses are showing very promising traction, with the early signals that we are seeing across demand, usage, and retention increasing our confidence in the long-run potential of AR glasses.",
      "Finally, as we pursue these investments across near- and long-term priorities, we will remain focused on operating the business efficiently.",
      "We expect third quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $38.5-41 billion.",
      "Our guidance assumes foreign currency is a 2% headwind to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates.",
      "We expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96-99 billion, unchanged from our prior outlook.",
      "For Reality Labs, we continue to expect 2024 operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and investments to further scale our ecosystem.",
      "While we do not intend to provide any quantitative guidance for 2025 until the fourth quarter call, we expect infrastructure costs will be a significant driver of expense growth next year as we recognize depreciation and operating costs associated with our expanded infrastructure footprint.",
      "We anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $37-40 billion, updated from our prior range of $35-40 billion.",
      "While we continue to refine our plans for next year, we currently expect significant capex growth in 2025 as we invest to support our AI research and our product development efforts.",
      "Absent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our full-year 2024 tax rate to be in the mid-teens.",
      "In addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the US that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.",
      "We continue to execute well across our business priorities and have exciting opportunities in front of us to deliver more value to the people and businesses using our products around the world.",

      "I think that that's one of the advantages of an open source model like Llama is - - it's not like you're locked into one cloud that offers that model, whether it's Microsoft with OpenAI or Google with Gemini or whatever it is, you can take this and use it everywhere",
      "The enterprise and business applications that we're going to be most focused on, though, in addition to just optimizing the advertiser experience like I talked about in my comments earlier, it is the business agent piece.",
      "I just think that there's a huge potential like I said earlier.",
      "I think pretty much every business today, it has an e-mail address.",
      "I think in the future, they're going to have at least one, if not multiple business agents that can do the whole range of things from interacting to help people buy things to helping support the sales that they've done if they have issues with the product, if they need to get in touch with you for something.",
      "And we already see people interacting with businesses over messaging working quite well in countries that have low cost of labor.",
      "But the thing is that in order to have someone answering everyone's questions is quite expensive in a lot of countries.",
      "And I think that this is like a thing that AI, I think, is just going to be very well suited towards doing.",
      "And when we can make that easy for the hundreds of millions of businesses that use our platforms to pull in all their information and their catalogs and the history and all the content that they've shared and really just quickly stand up an agent, I think that's going to be awesome.",
      "So we can combine Llama with a lot of custom work that we're doing in our business teams and couple that with all the other investment that the rest of the ecosystem is doing to make Llama good.",
      "And I think that's going to be huge, but that's just one area.",
      "I mean this really goes across all of the different products that we're building, both consumer and business."

      "I guess my point there was it's just -- there's some lag between the technology becoming available and the products becoming kind of fully explored in the space.",

      "This was a good quarter with strong product and business momentum, and with parts of our long-term vision around AI and the future of computing coming into sharper focus.",
      "We estimate that there are now more than 3.2 billion people using at least one of our apps each day -- and we're seeing rapid adoption of Meta AI and Llama, which is quickly becoming a standard across the industry.",
      "So let's start with some highlights from the apps.",
      "For WhatsApp, the US remains one of our fastest growing countries.",
      "And we just passed a milestone of 2 billion calls made globally every day.",
      "On Facebook, we continue to see positive trends with young adults, especially in the US.",
      "We also launched Teen Accounts this quarter, which add built-in protections that limit who teens are messaging and what content they can see.",
      "On Threads, the community now has almost 275 million monthly actives.",
      "It has been growing more than 1 million sign-ups per day.",
      "So we continue to be on track towards this becoming our next major social app.",
      "We are making a lot of progress with our AI efforts too, and we're seeing AI have a positive impact on nearly all aspects of our work -- from our core business engagement and monetization to our long-term roadmaps for new services and computing platforms.",
      "And I think that this partially comes from having a vision and roadmap that is aligned with the direction that technology is heading, but even more importantly from our teams doing some really excellent work on execution on so many fronts.",
      "Meta AI now has more than 500 monthly actives.",
      "Improvements to our AI-driven feed and video recommendations have led to an 8% increase in time spent on Facebook and a 6% increase on Instagram this year alone.",
      "More than a million advertisers used our GenAI tools to create more than 15 million ads in the last month, and we estimate that businesses using Image Generation are seeing a 7% increase in conversions -- and we believe that there is a lot more upside here.",
      "Llama token usage has grown exponentially this year, and the more widely that Llama gets adopted and becomes the industry standard, the more that the improvements to its quality and efficiency will flow back to all of our products.",
      "This quarter, we released Llama 3.2, including the leading small models that run on-device and open source multi-modal models.",
      "We're working with enterprises to make it easier to use, and now we're also working with the public sector to adopt Llama across the US government.",
      "The Llama 3 models have been something of an inflection point in the industry, but I'm even more excited about Llama 4, which is now well into its development.",
      "We're training the Llama 4 models on a cluster that is bigger than 100k H100s or bigger than anything that I've seen reported for what others are doing.",
      "I expect that the smaller Llama 4 models will be ready first, and they’ll be ready, we expect sometime early next year, and I think that they're going to be a big deal on several fronts -- new modalities, capabilities, stronger reasoning, and much faster.",
      "It seems pretty clear to me that open source will be the most cost-effective, customizable, trustworthy, performant, and easiest-to-use option that is available to developers, and I'm proud that Llama is leading the way on this.",
      "Now it's the time of the year at Meta when we plan our budget for the next year.",
      "That's still in progress, but I wanted to share a few things that have stood out to me as we've gone through this process so far.",
      "First, it's clear that there are a lot of new opportunities to use new AI advances to accelerate our core business that should have strong ROI over the next few years, so I think we should invest more there.",
      "Second, our AI investments continue to require serious infrastructure, and I expect to continue investing significantly there too.",
      "We haven't decided on a final budget yet, but those are some of the directional trends I'm seeing.",
      "Moving on, this quarter we also had several milestones around Reality Labs and the integration of AI and wearables.",
      "Ray-Ban Meta glasses are the prime example here.",
      "They're great-looking glasses that let you take photos and videos, listen to music and take calls.",
      "But what makes them really special is the Meta AI integration.",
      "With our new updates it'll be able to not only answer your questions throughout the day, but also help you remember things, give you suggestions as you're doing things using real- time multimodal AI, and even translate other languages right in your ear for you.",
      "I continue to think that glasses are the ideal form factor for AI because you can let your AI see what you see, hear what you hear, and talk to you.",
      "Demand for the glasses continues to be very strong.",
      "The new clear edition that we released at Connect sold out almost immediately and has been trading online for over a thousand dollars.",
      "We've deepened our partnership with EssilorLuxottica to build future generations of smart eyewear that deliver both cutting-edge technology and style.",
      "At Connect we also showed Orion, our first full holographic AR glasses.",
      "We've been working on this one for about a decade, and it gives you a sense of where this is all going.",
      "We're not too far off from being able to deliver great-looking glasses that let you seamlessly blend the physical and digital worlds so you can feel present with anyone no matter where they are.",
      "We're starting to see the next computing platform come together, and it's pretty exciting.",
      "We also released our newest mixed reality headset: Quest 3S. It brings the best capabilities of Quest 3 -- high quality color passthrough, a new chipset, and more -- at the much more accessible price point of $300.",
      "Reviews are great so far, and I'm looking forward to seeing how well it does this holiday season as more people get their hands on it.",
      "I'm pretty amped about all the work that we're doing right now.",
      "This may be the most dynamic moment that I've seen in our industry, and I'm focused on making sure that we build some awesome things and make the most of the opportunities ahead.",
      "And if we do this well, then the potential for Meta and everyone building with us will be massive.",

      "There are two primary factors that drive our revenue performance: our ability to deliver engaging experiences for our community, and our effectiveness at monetizing that engagement over time.",
      "On the first, we are focused on both improving people’s experiences within our apps today and investing in longer-term initiatives that have the potential to contribute to engagement in the years ahead.",
      "We expect our content recommendations roadmap will span both of these timeframes, as we have nearer-term workstreams focused on improving recommendations as well as multi-year initiatives to develop innovative new approaches.",
      "In the third quarter, we continued to see daily usage grow year- over-year across Facebook and Instagram, both globally and in the U.S.",
      "On Facebook, we’re seeing strong results from the global rollout of our unified video player in June.",
      "Since introducing the new experience and prediction systems that power it, we’ve seen a 10% increase in time spent within the Facebook video player.",
      "This month, we’ve entered the next phase of Facebook’s video product evolution.",
      "Starting in the US & Canada, we are updating the standalone video tab to a full screen viewing experience, which will allow people to seamlessly watch videos in a more immersive experience.",
      "We expect to complete this global roll out in early 2025.",
      "On Instagram, Reels continues to see good traction and we’re making ongoing progress with our focus on promoting original content, with more than 60% of recommendations now coming from original posts in the U.S.",
      "This is helping people find unique and differentiated content on Instagram while also helping earlier stage creators get discovered.",
      "Next, let me talk more about our multi-year roadmap for recommendations.",
      "Previously, we operated separate ranking and recommendation systems for each of our products because we found that performance did not scale if we expanded the model size and compute power beyond a certain point.",
      "However, inspired by the scaling laws we were observing with large language models, last year we developed new ranking model architectures capable of learning more effectively from significantly larger data sets.",
      "To start, we have been deploying these new architectures to our Facebook video ranking models, which has enabled us to deliver more relevant recommendations and unlock meaningful gains in watch time.",
      "Now, we’re exploring whether these new models can unlock similar improvements to recommendations on other surfaces.",
      "After that, we will look to introduce cross-surface data to these models so our systems can learn from what is interesting to someone on one surface of our apps and use it to improve their recommendations on another.",
      "This will take time to execute, and there are other explorations that we will pursue in parallel.",
      "However, over time we are optimistic that this will unlock more relevant recommendations while also leading to higher engineering efficiency as we operate a smaller number of recommendation models.",
      "Beyond recommendations, we’re making progress with our other longer-term engagement priorities, including Generative AI and Threads.",
      "Meta AI usage continues to scale as we make it available in more countries and languages.",
      "We’re seeing lifts in usage as we improve our models and have introduced a number of enhancements in recent months to make Meta AI more helpful and engaging.",
      "Last month, we began introducing Voice, so you can speak with Meta AI more naturally, and it’s now fully available in English to people in the US, Australia, Canada and New Zealand.",
      "In the US, people can now also upload photos to Meta AI to learn more about them, write captions for posts, and add, remove, or change things about their images with a simple text prompt.",
      "These are all built with our first multi-modal foundation model, Llama 3.2.",
      "Threads remains another area where we see exciting potential.",
      "We are bringing on an increasing number of new users each quarter while depth of engagement also continues to grow.",
      "Looking ahead, we plan to introduce more features to make it even easier for people to stay up to date on topics they care about.",
      "Now to the second driver of our revenue performance: increasing monetization efficiency.",
      "The first is optimizing the level of ads within organic engagement.",
      "We continue to see opportunities to grow ad supply on lower monetizing surfaces, like video.",
      "Within Facebook, video engagement continues to shift to short form following the unification of our video player, and we expect this to continue with the transition of the video tab to a full screen format.",
      "This is resulting in organic video impressions growing more quickly than overall video time on Facebook, which provides more opportunities to serve ads.",
      "Across both Facebook and Instagram, we are also continuing our broader work to optimize when and where we should show ads within a person’s session.",
      "This is enabling us to drive revenue and conversion growth without increasing the number of ads.",
      "The second part of improving monetization efficiency is enhancing marketing performance.",
      "Similar to organic content ranking, we are finding opportunities to achieve meaningful ads performance gains by adopting new approaches to modeling.",
      "For example, we recently deployed new learning and modeling techniques that enable our ads systems to consider the sequence of actions a person takes before and after seeing an ad.",
      "Previously, our ads systems could only aggregate those actions together, without mapping the sequence.",
      "This new approach allows our systems to better anticipate how audiences will respond to specific ads.",
      "Since we adopted the new models in the first half of this year we’ve already seen a 2-4% increase in conversions based on testing within selected segments.",
      "We are also evolving our ads platform to ensure that the results we drive are customized to each business’ objectives and to the way they measure value.",
      "In Q3, we introduced changes to our ads ranking and optimization models to take more of the cross-publisher journey into account, which we expect to increase the Meta-attributed conversions that advertisers see in their third party analytics tools.",
      "We’re also testing new features and settings for advertisers that will allow them to optimize their campaigns for what they value most, such as driving incremental conversions rather than absolute conversions.",
      "Finally, there is continued momentum with our Advantage+ solutions, including our ad creative tools.",
      "We’re seeing strong retention with advertisers using our generative AI-powered image expansion, background generation and text generation tools, and they’re already driving improved performance for advertisers even at this early stage.",
      "Earlier this month we began testing our first video generation features - video expansion and image animation.",
      "We expect to make them more broadly available by early next year.",
      "Next, I would like to discuss our approach to capital allocation.",
      "We continue to take a long-term view in running the business, which involves investing in a portfolio of opportunities that we expect will generate returns over different time periods.",
      "We are very optimistic about the set of opportunities in front of us, and believe that investing now in both infrastructure and talent will not only accelerate our progress, but increase the likelihood of maximizing returns within each area.",
      "This includes investing in both near-term initiatives to deliver continued healthy revenue growth within our core business, as well as longer-term opportunities that have the scale to deliver compelling returns over time.",
      "Given the lead time of our longer-term investments, we also continue to maximize our flexibility so that we can react to market developments.",
      "Within Reality Labs, this has benefited us as we’ve evolved our roadmaps to respond to the earlier-than- expected success of smart glasses.",
      "Within generative AI, we expect significantly scaling up our infrastructure capacity now, while also prioritizing its fungibility, will similarly position us well to respond to how the technology and market develop in the years ahead.",
      "We expect fourth quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $45-48 billion.",
      "Our guidance assumes foreign currency is approximately neutral to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates.",
      "We expect full year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96-98 billion, updated from our prior range of $96-99 billion.",
      "For Reality Labs, we continue to expect 2024 operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and investments to further scale our ecosystem.",
      "We anticipate our full year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $38-40 billion, updated from our prior range of $37-40 billion.",
      "We continue to expect significant capital expenditures growth in 2025.",

      "It may not even be from people that you’re following directly.",
      "It could just be recommended content from creators that we can algorithmically determine is going to be interesting and engaging and valuable to you.",

      "And I think that that’s going to be just very exciting for the - - for Facebook and Instagram and maybe Threads or other kind of Feed experiences over time.",

      "I don’t know that -- this isn’t going to be a big impact on the business in ‘25 would be my guess.",

      "But you’re going to get that, you’re going to get Meta AI, AI Studio, business AIs and a whole lot of things that developers would do with Llama too."

      "In terms of the specific line items: Cost of revenue increased 15%, driven mostly by higher infrastructure costs.",
      "R&D increased 16%, primarily driven by higher employee compensation and infrastructure costs, which were partially offset by lower restructuring costs.",

      "In Q4, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 6% and the average price per ad increased 14%.",
      "Pricing growth benefited from increased advertiser demand, in part driven by improved ad performance.",
      "This was partially offset by impression growth, particularly from lower-monetizing regions and surfaces.",
      "Family of Apps other revenue was $519 million, up 55%, driven primarily by business messaging revenue growth from our WhatsApp Business Platform.",
      "We continue to direct the majority of our investments toward the development and operation of our Family of Apps.",
      "In Q4, Family of Apps expenses were $19.0 billion, representing 76% of our overall expenses.",
      "Family of Apps expenses were up 5%, primarily due to growth in infrastructure costs and employee compensation, which were partially offset by lower legal-related expenses.",

      "Reality Labs expenses were $6.0 billion, up 6% year-over-year driven primarily by higher infrastructure costs and employee compensation, partially offset by lower restructuring costs.",
      "There are two primary factors that drive our revenue performance: our ability to deliver engaging experiences for our community, and our effectiveness at monetizing that engagement over time.",
      "On the first, daily actives continue to grow across Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp year-over- year, both globally and in the United States.",
      "In Q4, global video time grew at double digit percentages year-over-year on Instagram, and we’re seeing particular strength in the US on Facebook, where video time spent was also up double digit rates year-over-year.",
      "We see continued opportunities to drive video growth in 2025 through ongoing optimizations to our ranking systems.",
      "We’re also making several product bets that are focused on setting up our platforms for longer-term success.",
      "On Instagram, we continue to prioritize original posts in recommendations to help smaller creators get discovered.",
      "We also want to ensure creators have a place to experiment with their content, so we introduced a new feature in Q4 that allows creators to first share a Reel with people who don’t follow them.",
      "This allows them to test content and see what performs best before deciding to share it with their followers, and also helps introduce them to entirely new audiences.",
      "Creative tools is another area we’re investing in.",
      "In the coming weeks, we’ll launch a new standalone app called Edits that provides a full suite of creative tools to make it easier for creators to make great Reels on their phone.",
      "Another focus is making it easier for people to connect over content.",
      "Reels are already reshared over 4.5 billion times a day, and we’ve been introducing more features that bring together the social and entertainment aspects of Instagram.",
      "In the US, we recently launched a new destination in Reels that consists of content your friends have left a note on or liked.",
      "We’re seeing very positive early results and will look to expand this globally in the coming months.",
      "On Threads, we made tremendous progress in 2024 and our focus this year is establishing Threads as the place people come to keep up with what they care about.",
      "We’re making a number of updates to our recommendation systems to prioritize more recent posts, surface content from top creators, and ensure people see more of the content from accounts they follow.",
      "We will also continue improving custom feeds so people can build personalized feeds on topics they’re interested in.",
      "Finally, Meta AI usage continues to scale, with more than 700 million monthly actives.",
      "We’re now introducing updates that will enable Meta AI to deliver more personalized and relevant responses by remembering certain details from people’s prior queries and considering what they engage with on Facebook and Instagram to develop better intuition for their interests and preferences.",
      "Now to the second driver of our revenue performance: increasing monetization efficiency.",
      "The first part of this work is optimizing the level of ads within organic engagement.",
      "We continue to grow supply on lower monetizing surfaces, like video, while optimizing ad supply on each of our surfaces to deliver ads at the time and place they will be most relevant to people.",
      "For example, we are continuing to better personalize when ads show up, including the optimal locations in the depth of someone’s feed, to introduce ad supply when it’s most optimal for the user and revenue.",
      "Longer term, we also see impression growth opportunities on unmonetized surfaces like Threads, which we are beginning to test ads on this quarter.",
      "We expect the introduction of ads on Threads will be gradual and don’t anticipate it being a meaningful driver of overall impression or revenue growth in 2025.",
      "The second part of increasing monetization efficiency is improving marketing performance.",
      "The ongoing enhancements to our ads ranking systems are an important driver of this work.",
      "In the second half of 2024, we introduced an innovative new machine learning system in partnership with Nvidia, called Andromeda.",
      "This more efficient system enabled a 10,000x increase in the complexity of models we use for ads retrieval, which is the part of the ranking process where we narrow down a pool of tens of millions of ads to the few thousand we consider showing someone.",
      "The increase in model complexity is enabling us to run far more sophisticated prediction models to better personalize which ads we show someone.",
      "This has driven an 8% increase in the quality of ads that people see on objectives we’ve tested.",
      "Andromeda’s ability to efficiently process larger volumes of ads also positions us well for the future as advertisers use our generative AI tools to create and test more ads.",
      "Another way we’re delivering value for advertisers is through increased automation of their ad campaigns with Advantage+.",
      "Adoption of Advantage+ shopping campaigns continues to scale, with revenue surpassing a $20 billion annual run-rate and growing 70% year-over-year in Q4.",
      "Given the strong performance and interest we’re seeing in Advantage+ Shopping and our other end-to-end solutions, we’re testing a new streamlined campaign creation flow so advertisers no longer need to choose between running a manual or Advantage+ Sales or App campaign.",
      "In this new setup, all campaigns optimizing for sales, app or lead objectives will have Advantage+ turned on from the beginning.",
      "This will allow more advertisers to take advantage of the performance Advantage+ offers while still having the ability to further customize aspects of their campaigns when they need to.",
      "We plan to expand to more advertisers in the coming months before fully rolling it out later in the year.",
      "Advantage+ creative is another area where we’re seeing momentum.",
      "More than 4 million advertisers are now using at least one of our generative AI ad creative tools, up from one million six months ago.",
      "There has been significant early adoption of our first video generation tool that we rolled out in October, Image Animation, with hundreds of thousands of advertisers already using it monthly.",
      "Next, I would like to discuss our approach to capital allocation.",
      "Our primary focus remains investing capital back into the business, with infrastructure and talent being our top priorities.",
      "On the first, we expect compute will be central to many of the opportunities we’re pursuing as we advance the capabilities of Llama, drive increased usage of generative AI products and features across our platform, and fuel core ads and organic engagement initiatives.",
      "We’re working to meet the growing capacity needs for these services by both scaling our infrastructure footprint and increasing the efficiency of our workloads.",
      "Another way we’re pursuing efficiencies is by extending the useful lives of our servers and associated networking equipment.",
      "Our expectation going forward is that we’ll be able to use both our non-AI and AI servers for a longer period of time before replacing them, which we estimate will be approximately five and a half years.",
      "This will deliver savings in annual capex and resulting depreciation expense, which is already included in our guidance.",
      "Finally, we’re pursuing cost efficiencies by deploying our custom MTIA silicon in areas where we can achieve a lower cost of compute by optimizing the chip to our unique workloads.",
      "In 2024 we started deploying MTIA to our ranking and recommendation inference workloads for ads and organic content.",
      "We expect to further ramp adoption of MTIA for these use cases throughout 2025 before extending our custom silicon efforts to training workloads for ranking and recommendations next year.",
      "From a hiring standpoint, our focus continues to be on adding technical talent to support our strategic priorities.",

      "We are in a phase where we are really learning a lot from the way that people engage with Meta AI.",
      "So from an app perspective, WhatsApp continues to see the strongest Meta AI usage across our Family of Apps.",
      "People there are using it most frequently for information seeking and educational queries along with emotional support use cases.",
      "Most of the WhatsApp engagement is in one-on-one threads, though we see some usage in group messaging.",
      "And on Facebook, which is the second largest driver of Meta AI engagement, we’re seeing strong engagement from our feed deep dives integration that lets people ask Meta AI questions about the content that is recommended to them.",
      "So across, I would say, all query types, we continue to see signs that Meta AI is helping people leverage our apps for new use cases.",
      "We talked about information gathering, social interaction and communication.",
      "Lots of people use it for humor and casual conversation.",
      "They use it for writing and editing, research, recommendations.",
      "And as we look forward to 2025 in our Meta AI roadmap, we are really focused on doing more to make it feel more personalized.",
      "So I would say some of the most exciting features we’re working on including improving sort of the memory dimension of the Meta AI experience, where it will be able to remember certain details that people share in one-on-one chats, for example, and use those details to personalize its responses and then really increasing its ability to deliver great content recommendations and enhance really what makes Facebook and Instagram so valuable for people today."

      "So it’s a good segue after infrastructure, employee compensation is the next largest driver of expense growth in 2025.",
      "And here, growth in employee comp and headcount more broadly is primarily driven by those areas that I mentioned, infrastructure monetization, generative AI, Reality Labs, and regulation and compliance.",
      "That means that it is a higher cost base relative to business functions where we are also expecting to keep headcount growth constrained.",

      "So I guess a couple of things that I’d say on this.",
      "One is when you’re thinking about agents and reasoning, a lot of this is about being able to perform multistep tasks.",
      "So right now the way that a lot of these systems work is you kind of say something and then it responds and it’s almost chat",
      "But I think that the direction that it’s going is you’re going to be able to give it an intent or a task and it’s going to be able to go off and use sort of an arbitrary amount of compute as much as you want to use on it to be able to do a task.",

      "But it’s sort of another generation of these products.",
      "So I think it’s just in general, there’s a lot to build and be excited about.",
      "I guess my note of caution or just my kind of periodic reminder on our product development process, if you will, is we build these products.",
      "We try to scale them to reach usually a billion people or more.",
      "And it’s at that point once they’re at scale that we really start focusing on monetization.",
      "So sometimes we’ll experiment with monetization before, we’re running some experiments with Threads now for example.",
      "But we typically don’t really ramp these things up or see them as meaningfully contributing to the business until we reach quite a big scale.",
      "So the thing that I think is going to be meaningful this year is the kind of getting of the AI products to scale.",
      "Last year was sort of the introduction and starting to get it to be used.",
      "This year my kind of expectation and hope is that we will be at a sufficient scale and have sufficient kind of flywheel of people using it and improvement from that that this will have a durable advantage.",

      "This year, the improvements to the business are going to be taking the AI methods and applying them to advertising and recommendations and feeds and things like that.",
      "So the actual business opportunity for Meta AI and AI Studio and business agents and people interacting with these AIs remains outside of ‘25 for the most part.",
      "And I think that’s an important thing for us to communicate and for people to internalize as you’re thinking about our prospects here.",
